Crack the Multi-Channel Voice of Customer (VoC) data conundrum using LLMs.
In today's digital landscape, customer feedback and sentiments are dispersed across various channels such as LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Twitter, Email, App Reviews, Instagram, Facebook, and more. Collating this Voice of Customer (VoC) data is pivotal for organizations to understand customer needs, pain points, and preferences.

However, the diverse sources and unstructured nature of this data pose challenges in processing, denoising, and extracting actionable insights effectively.

The challenge is to develop an AI-powered solution that uses snap-ins to seamlessly aggregate VoC data from multiple channels. This solution should leverage the capabilities of the DevRev platform, utilizing its APIs for data ingestion and an omnichannel inbox for displaying actionable items to internal teams.
