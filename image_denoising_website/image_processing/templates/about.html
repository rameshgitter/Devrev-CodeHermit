            <p>This website was built using a combination of HTML, CSS (with the Tailwind CSS utility framework), JavaScript, and the Django web framework for Python. The front-end was designed with a modern and responsive layout, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.</p>
            <p>The image processing functionality is handled on the server-side using Python's powerful image processing libraries, such as Pillow and OpenCV. These libraries provide a wide range of image manipulation and filtering techniques, allowing us to offer a diverse set of options to our users.</p>
            <p>The Django framework was used to handle server-side operations, including form handling, image processing, and serving the processed images back to the client. Django's built-in security features, such as CSRF protection, ensure a secure and robust application.</p>
